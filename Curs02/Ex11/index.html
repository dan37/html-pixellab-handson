    Berlin, Germanyâ€™s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century<br>
    history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the<br>
    Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also<br>
    known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner<br>
    Philharmonie, built in 1963.

    The cat is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and<br>
    often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is<br>
    either a house cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral cat, which ranges freely and avoids<br>
    human contact
